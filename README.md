# Project - Higher Education Consulting Analytics

In this project we took data about cars companies, models, engines, CC/battery capacities, horsepower, top speed, 0-100 km/h performance, prices (in US dollars), fuel types, seating capacity, and torque from 2025. This covers a wide variety of cars from EVs to standard fuel, sports cars to utility vans, and luxury to standard model cars. We sought to provide insights on how performance an price are related, is title really everything in price, how fast are the fastest cars going and other information that might interest car buers and enthusiasts.

## Summary

# üöó Car Performance & Value Analysis

This project explores a dataset of cars, cleaning raw manufacturer data into structured, quantitative insights, and analyzing performance, price, and value across models and fuel types.

---

## üìä Dataset Overview

**Original Dataset (`cars`)**
The raw data contains specs from various car manufacturers, including engine types, performance metrics, pricing, and seating capacity. However, many fields were stored as text with units or ranges (e.g., `"70-85 hp"`, `"$12,000-$15,000"`), requiring preprocessing.

**Cleaned Dataset (`cars_cleaned`)**
A cleaned and structured version of the dataset, with all numerical columns converted into usable float values and new performance/value metrics created.

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Transformation

| Original Column         | Action                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `HorsePower`            | Removed "hp", handled ranges (`70-85 hp` ‚Üí `77.5`), converted to float   |
| `Cars Prices`           | Removed "\$" and commas, handled ranges, converted to float (USD)        |
| `Torque`                | Removed "Nm", handled ranges, converted to float                         |
| `Seats`                 | Converted "2+2" to 4, took the **maximum** in ranges (e.g., `2-12 ‚Üí 12`) |
| `CC/Battery Capacity`   | Removed "cc", converted to numeric (`float`)                             |
| `0-100 KM/H`            | Converted to float (in seconds)                                          |
| `Top Speed`             | Converted "km/h" to numeric                                              |
| `Fuel Types`, `Engines` | Preserved as categorical features                                        |

**Missing Values Handling:**

* **Dropped** rows missing: `Seats`, `Price_USD`, `0-100 KM/H`
* **Imputed** missing:

  * `HorsePower` ‚Üí avg of similar `Engine` + `Torque` + `Top Speed`
  * `Torque` ‚Üí avg of similar `Engine` + `HorsePower` + `Top Speed`
  * `CC/Battery` ‚Üí avg of similar `Engine` + `HorsePower` + `Torque`

### üìä Categorical Insights

* **Average HorsePower by Fuel Type**
* **Car Count by Price Bins** (`$0-50K`, `$50K-100K`, ..., `$1M+`) with labels

### üìà Correlation Analysis

* **Heatmap of All Numeric Variables**
* **Price vs Performance Score Scatterplot** with **broken y-axis** to show high-end outliers clearly

### üí° Value Analysis
